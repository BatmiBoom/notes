# MODULES

## Importing

In python, each `.py` file is a module, and we can import functions, variables, and classes from one module into another with the `import` statement.

```python
from filename import function_hello, variable_player
```

If you want to import everything from a file, you can use the `*` character:

```python
from filename import *
```
