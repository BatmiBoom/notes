# GIT

Git is the distributed version control system (VCS). Nearly every developer in the world uses it to manage their code. It has quite a monopoly on VCS. Developers use Git to:

- Keep a history of their code changes
- Revert mistakes made in their code
- Collaborate with other developers
- Make backups of their code
- And much more
