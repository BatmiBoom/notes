# Data Structures

A data structure is a data oganization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

In other words:

- Storages Data
- Organizes data in such a way that we can read and modify quickly
- Imlpements algorithmic functinos that expose the ability to read and modify the data

Simplest Data Structures:

- Lists (an ordered collection of data)
- Dictionaries (key -> value map of data)
- Sets (unordered callection of data without duplicates)

## List Indexing

While iterating over each item in a list is `O(n)`, not every lookup strategy based on lists falls into the same category.

**Array indexing** accesses an element in an array using its index number.

Structures:

- [Stack](./stack.md)
- [Queue](./queue.md)
- [Linked List](./linked_list.md)
- [Tree](./tree.md)
- [Hash Map](./hash_map.md)
- [Tries](./trie.md)
- [Graph](./graph.md)
