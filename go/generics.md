# GENERICS

## TYPE PARAMETERS

Put simply, generics allow us to use variables to refer to specific types. This is an amazing feature because it allows us to write abstract functions that drastically reduce code duplication.

```go
func splitAnySlice[T any](s []T) ([]T, []T) {
    mid := len(s)/2
    return s[:mid], s[mid:]
}
```

In the example above, `T` is the name of the type parameter for the `splitAnySlice` function, and we've said that it must match the `any` constraint, which means it can be anything. This makes sense because the body of the function doesn't care about the types of things stored in the slice.

```go
firstInts, secondInts := splitAnySlice([]int{0, 1, 2, 3})
fmt.Println(firstInts, secondInts)
```

## ZERO VALUE OF A TYPE

Creating a variable that's the zero value of a type is easy:

`var myZeroInt int`

It's the same with generics, we just have a variable that represents the type:

`var myZero T`

**WHY GENERICS?**

- GENERICS REDUCE REPETITIVE CODE
  You should care about generics because they mean you donâ€™t have to write as much code! It can be frustrating to write the same logic over and over again, just because you have some underlying data types that are slightly different.

- GENERICS ARE USED MORE OFTEN IN LIBRARIES AND PACKAGES
  Generics give Go developers an elegant way to write amazing utility packages. While you will see and use generics in application code, I think it will be much more common to see generics used in libraries and packages. Libraries and packages contain importable code intended to be used in many applications, so it makes sense to write them in a more abstract way. Generics are often the way to do just that!

## CONSTRAINTS

Sometimes you need the logic in your generic function to know something about the types it operates on. The example we used in the first exercise didn't need to know anything about the types in the slice, so we used the built-in any constraint:

```go
func splitAnySlice[T any](s []T) ([]T, []T) {
    mid := len(s)/2
    return s[:mid], s[mid:]
}
```

Constraints are just interfaces that allow us to write generics that only operate within the constraints of a given interface type. In the example above, the any constraint is the same as the empty interface because it means the type in question can be anything.

### CUSTOM CONSTRAINT

Let's take a look at the example of a `concat` function. It takes a slice of values and concatenates the values into a string. This should work with any type that can represent itself as a string, even if it's not a string under the hood. For example, a user `struct` can have a .String() that returns a string with the user's name and age.

```go
type stringer interface {
    String() string
}

func concat[T stringer](vals []T) string {
    result := ""
    for _, val := range vals {
        // this is where the .String() method
        // is used. That's why we need a more specific
        // constraint instead of the any constraint
        result += val.String()
    }
    return result
}
```

## EXAMPLE

```go
func getLast[T any](s []T) T {
	var generic T
	if len(s) == 0 {
		return generic
	}

	return s[len(s) - 1]
}
```

```go
func chargeForLineItem[T lineItem](newItem T, oldItems []T, balance float64) ([]T, float64, error) {
	var generic []T
	if balance < newItem.GetCost() {
		return generic, 0, errors.New("insufficient funds")
	}

	oldItems = append(oldItems, newItem)

	return oldItems, balance - newItem.GetCost(), nil
}

type lineItem interface {
	GetCost() float64
	GetName() string
}

type subscription struct {
	userEmail string
	startDate time.Time
	interval  string
}

func (s subscription) GetName() string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("%s subscription", s.interval)
}

func (s subscription) GetCost() float64 {
	if s.interval == "monthly" {
		return 25.00
	}
	if s.interval == "yearly" {
		return 250.00
	}
	return 0.0
}

type oneTimeUsagePlan struct {
	userEmail        string
	numEmailsAllowed int
}

func (otup oneTimeUsagePlan) GetName() string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("one time usage plan with %v emails", otup.numEmailsAllowed)
}

func (otup oneTimeUsagePlan) GetCost() float64 {
	const costPerEmail = 0.03
	return float64(otup.numEmailsAllowed) * costPerEmail
}
```

### INTERFACE TYPE LISTS

When generics were released, a new way of writing interfaces was also released at the same time!

We can now simply list a bunch of types to get a new interface/constraint.

```go
// Ordered is a type constraint that matches any ordered type.
// An ordered type is one that supports the <, <=, >, and >= operators.
type Ordered interface {
    ~int | ~int8 | ~int16 | ~int32 | ~int64 |
        ~uint | ~uint8 | ~uint16 | ~uint32 | ~uint64 | ~uintptr |
        ~float32 | ~float64 |
        ~string
}
```

### PARAMETRIC CONSTRAINTS

Your interface definitions, which can later be used as constraints, can accept type parameters as well.

```go
// The store interface represents a store that sells products.
// It takes a type parameter P that represents the type of products the store sells.
type store[P product] interface {
	Sell(P)
}

type product interface {
	Price() float64
	Name() string
}

type book struct {
	title  string
	author string
	price  float64
}

func (b book) Price() float64 {
	return b.price
}

func (b book) Name() string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("%s by %s", b.title, b.author)
}

type toy struct {
	name  string
	price float64
}

func (t toy) Price() float64 {
	return t.price
}

func (t toy) Name() string {
	return t.name
}

// The bookStore struct represents a store that sells books.
type bookStore struct {
	booksSold []book
}

// Sell adds a book to the bookStore's inventory.
func (bs *bookStore) Sell(b book) {
	bs.booksSold = append(bs.booksSold, b)
}

// The toyStore struct represents a store that sells toys.
type toyStore struct {
	toysSold []toy
}

// Sell adds a toy to the toyStore's inventory.
func (ts *toyStore) Sell(t toy) {
	ts.toysSold = append(ts.toysSold, t)
}

// sellProducts takes a store and a slice of products and sells
// each product one by one.
func sellProducts[P product](s store[P], products []P) {
	for _, p := range products {
		s.Sell(p)
	}
}

func main() {
	bs := bookStore{
		booksSold: []book{},
	}

    // By passing in "book" as a type parameter, we can use the sellProducts function to sell books in a bookStore
	sellProducts[book](&bs, []book{
		{
			title:  "The Hobbit",
			author: "J.R.R. Tolkien",
			price:  10.0,
		},
		{
			title:  "The Lord of the Rings",
			author: "J.R.R. Tolkien",
			price:  20.0,
		},
	})
	fmt.Println(bs.booksSold)

    // We can then do the same for toys
	ts := toyStore{
		toysSold: []toy{},
	}
	sellProducts[toy](&ts, []toy{
		{
			name:  "Lego",
			price: 10.0,
		},
		{
			name:  "Barbie",
			price: 20.0,
		},
	})
	fmt.Println(ts.toysSold)
}
```

### NAMING GENERIC TYPES

Let's look at this simple example again :

```go
func splitAnySlice[T any](s []T) ([]T, []T) {
    mid := len(s)/2
    return s[:mid], s[mid:]
}
```

Remember,`T` is just a variable name, We could have named the type parameter anything.`T` happens to be a fairly common convention for a type variable, similar to how `i` is a convention for index variables in loops.

This is just as valid:

```go
func splitAnySlice[MyAnyType any](s []MyAnyType) ([]MyAnyType, []MyAnyType) {
    mid := len(s)/2
    return s[:mid], s[mid:]
}
```
