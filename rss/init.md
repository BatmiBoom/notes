# RSS

RSS stands for "Really Simple Syndication" and is a way to get the latest content from a website in a structured format. It's fairly ubiquitous on the web: most content sites have an RSS feed.

## Structure of an RSS Feed
RSS is a specific structure of XML. We will keep it simple and only worry about a few fields. Here's an example of the documents we'll parse:

```xml
<rss xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" version="2.0">
<channel>
  <title>RSS Feed Example</title>
  <link>https://www.example.com</link>
  <description>This is an example RSS feed</description>
  <item>
    <title>First Article</title>
    <link>https://www.example.com/article1</link>
    <description>This is the content of the first article.</description>
    <pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2021 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
  </item>
  <item>
    <title>Second Article</title>
    <link>https://www.example.com/article2</link>
